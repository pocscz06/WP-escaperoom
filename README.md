Overview:
Create an interactive online escape room game where players solve puzzles and riddles to "escape" within a time limit.

    • Puzzle Mechanics: Implement different types of puzzles, such as word ciphers, math riddles, or pattern recognition challenges using PHP form processing.
    • Timer Functionality: Use PHP sessions to track the remaining time for players.
    • Hint System: Provide limited hints for players who get stuck, reducing their final score.
    • Progress Tracking: Save progress with cookies/sessions so players can continue where they left off.
    • Winning & Losing Conditions: Display a success message if the player escapes within the time or a failure message if they run out of time.
